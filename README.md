# VR-Table
In the late 90's I participated in a few Dungeons and Dragons session that took place in public chat rooms on the internet. The medium was lacking at best. It had rudimentary dice rolling abilities, no way to share images, sounds or music and it was often hard to follow the Game Master(GM). The GM would have to type things out which took time and meanwhile players kept chatting with each other forcing the GM's messages to scroll off the screen. I had the crazy idea to build a chat room specifically for playing D&D. So I came up with the Virtual Roleplaying Table in the hope of not only allowing people to play online, but also to make the experience as close to the real thing as possible. 

## Feature List
* Allow the GM and all of the players to connect together in a private session
* Separate views for DM and the player messages
* Private message between player and the GM 
* DM could preset icons, fonts and colors for each NPC to help distinguish them. 
* DM could easily build maps and share with the players
* DM could play sounds or music on the players clients
* A detailed dice rolling system with common presets like 6D6
* A plugin system so player or DM with a compiler could add their own utilites
* Built in character sheet system so the DM could easily view a characters stats and abilities
